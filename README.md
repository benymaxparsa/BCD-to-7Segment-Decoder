# BCD-to-7Segment-Decoder
A BCD to 7 Segment Decoder implemented in Proteus 8

A project for our Digital Logic Circuit Design class taught by Prof. Sharifi.

Project by Parsa KamaliPour (me), Ali MohammadZade, Hossein Ahmadi.

# âš  Warning:
Do Not Copy this Project and submit it as your own project to your Professor!

This project is here only for you to learn how to do this stuff.

# Project info:
Design a Decoder that translate a BCD number to a decimal number and shows it on a 7 Segment.

Our Input must be between 0000 upto 1001 (representing number 0 upto 9)

Project was implemented using Proteus 8.11
